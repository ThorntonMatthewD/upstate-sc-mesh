# Upstate SC Mesh

## Overview

This project is the official website for **Upstate SC Mesh**, a community dedicated to building and maintaining an off-grid communication network in the Upstate of South Carolina and beyond. Utilizing the open-source Meshtastic project, we aim to provide reliable, long-range communication for various purposes, including outdoor activities, emergency preparedness, and general community connectivity where traditional cell service may be unavailable.

## What is Meshtastic?

[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) is an open-source project that leverages affordable, low-power LoRa devices to create a decentralized, off-grid communication network. It's ideal for situations requiring robust communication independent of traditional infrastructure, such as:

*   **Hiking and Outdoor Adventures:** Stay connected in remote areas.
*   **Emergency Preparedness:** Maintain communication during outages or disasters.
*   **Community Building:** Connect with like-minded individuals and expand local network coverage.

## Our Community

Upstate SC Mesh is comprised of enthusiasts, hobbyists, and prepared individuals passionate about resilient communication. While our primary focus is the Upstate of South Carolina, our network and community are open to anyone interested in contributing to or benefiting from the Meshtastic ecosystem across South Carolina and neighboring regions. We encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual support to expand our network's reach and capabilities.
